# FunRace

To do this test I have used the entire 5h available.

**Difficul parts**

In my opinion I had no parts that I found difficult but the really difficulty on this test i found out it is the time. With the short amount of time, my strategy has been to focus in a simple game , but with a closed cycle and a playable / fun game.


**Improvement parts**

First of all, I would improve the gameplay of the levels because now it is just a straight line with a couple of obstacles. To improve it I would add some curves, ups and downs, items, etc. But to do that I would probably need some more time.

Second of all, I would improve the visual aspect of the game, since I had not much time left to make the levels more attractive in the eyes of the players.



**Next steps**

Definetly the next step for this game would be to add the multiplayer part of the game to be able to play online againts other users.


**Opinion**

I assume the main point of this test is, like a speed test, see what the developer can do in a short period of time. So, in my point of view, it is better to have a simple game with its cycle closed and completly playable, than a more complex but unfinished game which users can't play it or test it.
